## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
Hello Hacker!

Thanks for checking out the Stacks Track! We think it‚Äôs one of the best opportunities at the MIT Bitcoin Expo hackathon to experiment with web3 on Bitcoin. The [Stacks blockchain](https://www.stacks.co/) is a really unique implementation of a smart contract-enabled decentralized network, and developers are praising the short learning curve for beginners and high functionality ceiling for experts.  

It uses the [**proof-of-transfer**](https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/proof-of-transfer) consensus mechanism, which is a totally novel method of securing a blockchain by expanding the security of a more established network. In this case, PoX miners on Stacks commit BTC to compete for mined blocks, instead of expending electricity or computational power. Stacks also has a secondary value creation mechanism built-in, [Stacking](https://www.stacks.co/learn/stacking), where the BTC that miners committed is then divided and rewarded to ‚ÄúStackers‚Äù. These Stackers have supported the network by locking up STX tokens for a number of cycles, and are rewarded with a proportion of the BTC used in mining. 

One final special aspect of Stacks is its smart contract programming language, [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/). Ethereum‚Äôs Solidity language proved the potential and desire for expressive web3 applications over the last few years, but it is buggy, hard to learn, and easy for beginners to overlook potential attack vectors. Stacks‚Äô smart contract framework, Clarity, was designed explicitly to overcome some of the shortcomings and vulnerabilities that have been observed around the crypto industry. It‚Äôs turing-incompleteness prevents the chaotic and variable gas markets that have made Ethereum so inaccessible to retail consumers. It‚Äôs also based on LISP, a familiar language that allows newcomers to easily translate experience with parenthetical architectures to Clarity. 

Dapps, DeFi, DAOs, NFTs, memecoins, it‚Äôs all possible on Stacks with Clarity and a little bit of creativity.

### üè´ My First Clarity Smart Contract
You may have considered building on blockchain in the past, but smart contract development appeared intimidating and unapproachable with user funds on the line. Fortunately, the Clarity smart contract language on Stacks is LISP-based and very easy to grok for beginner devs and expert engineers alike. We wanted to give hackers an opportunity to hack on the Stacks track, even if they‚Äôre questioning if they have enough experience to create a more robust submission.

We want you to build your first Clarity smart contract! It can be fairly basic, as long as it demonstrates that you took the hackathon to absorb Clarity education resources and documentation. There are hundreds of samples, templates, boilerplates, or just example Clarity smart contract files on Github. One of the best ways to learn is find and get familiar with a smart contract in the wild, fork it, and then tweak it incrementally into something totally new that achieves functionality you desire.

### üí± DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
DeFi is a new financial ecosystem, built on blockchain, in which users are totally in control of their funds, platforms are decentralized, and there is no barrier to entry like accredited investor status or brokerage fees. It enables a plethora of financial mechanisms like decentralized exchanges, yield farming, stablecoins, derivatives, crypto credit, and asset management. Hacker could develop a component of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) built on Stacks, that runs on Clarity smart contracts. Another option would be to build a dashboard that analyzes DeFi market statistics on Stacks.

### üîÑ Stacks <> Bitcoin Connection
The Stacks Blockchain has a unique purview into the Bitcoin network, and synergy with BTC due to it powering the Stacks consensus mechanism. There have already been a handful of examples out in the community, experimenting with different ways Stacks and Bitcoin can interact. We want hackers to build any component of a decentralized application, or smart contract, that utilizes both the Stacks and Bitcoin networks and performs some cross-chain functionality. 

#### Examples and Research to get you started with the Stacks <> Bitcoin connection:
[LNSwap](https://www.lnswap.org/faq)
LNSwap is a non custodial crypto currency exchange that provides a fast, private way of swapping Bitcoin for Stacks and vice versa. Non custodial exchanges give you full control over your funds. A trade happens entirely and the user gets the exact amount of the asset they were promised, or a full refund is issued. This concept is called atomicity and it is achieved with so-called Submarine Swaps.

[Blog Post on Submarine Swaps by Boltz](https://medium.com/boltzhq/submarine-swaps-c509ce0fb1db)
A Submarine Swap is a way to trustlessly exchange coins from lightning to on-chain addresses and vice versa.

[‚ÄúBitcoin DeFi is Here: A Deep Dive into Trust-less Swaps‚Äù by Muneeb Ali](https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-defi-is-here-a-deep-dive-into-trust-less-swaps)
Stacks co-founder, Muneeb Ali, explains why STX is uniquely positioned to enable true Bitcoin DeFi, given Stacks contracts' visibility into the Bitcoin state as well as Stacks‚Äô inherent ability to leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs security and settlement assurances. The Stacks chain is tethered to Bitcoin through its Proof of Transfer consensus mechanism, so all Stacks transactions settle on Bitcoin. This ensures that Stacks shares Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term, unparalleled security for transaction reorgs.  

[get-block-info Documentation](https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/language-functions#get-block-info)
Can be used to compare data from both Stacks and Bitcoin. The get-block-info? function fetches data for a block of the given Stacks block height. Then, the merkle root of the Bitcoin transaction and the provided merkle proof is compared with the merkle root of the verified block. If these hashes are identical it can be concluded that the Bitcoin transaction was indeed included in the block on the Bitcoin chain.

["What Are Submarine Swaps? Send Bitcoin from Mainnet to Lightning Network & Back‚Äù by Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/submarine-swaps/)
Submarine swaps have several profound use cases and potential implications. Unlike atomic swaps ‚Äî where LN needs to be enabled on both cryptocurrencies participating in an exchange ‚Äî submarine swaps only need one side to be lightning enabled. As such, the future application of submarine swaps could see them becoming a vital infrastructure for decentralized exchange across various blockchains.

[Github Repository of Community Swap Contracts by Friedger](https://github.com/friedger/clarity-catamaranswaps)
A collection of smart contracts by one of the leading community developers, Friedger Muffke. Demonstrates a handful of atomic and catamaran swaps in which BTC is exchanged for STX, an NFT, or another fungible token. Written in Clarity, 

[CatamaranSwaps](https://www.catamaranswaps.org/index.html)
A trustless exchange for digital assets, offering catamaran swaps, atomic swaps, and special support for a handful of tokens.

[Trustless Swap on Stacks chain: NFT vs $BTC by Friedger](https://app.sigle.io/friedger.id/A-l0d8h0Bq7uEGTWl004B)
Friedger describes swapping a Boombox NFT for mainnet Bitcoin.

[Exploring the Possibilities of Wrapped Bitcoin (xBTC) on Stacks by Hiro Team](https://www.hiro.so/blog/exploring-the-possibilities-of-wrapped-bitcoin-xbtc-on-stacks)
Wrapped assets are super helpful for interoperability and are how networks can connect L1 tokens with DeFi. On the Stacks network, Bitcoin is bridged into xBTC by wrapping it. Now users have xBTC as a token on the Stacks network, and they can connect xBTC to DeFi applications.
