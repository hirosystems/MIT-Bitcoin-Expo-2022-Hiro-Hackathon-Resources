## üí°Project Ideas
#### ‚§µÔ∏è [My First Clarity Smart Contract](https://github.com/hirosystems/MIT-Bitcoin-Expo-2022-Hiro-Hackathon-Resources#my-first-clarity-smart-contract-1)
Learn the essentials of the Clarity smart contract language for the Stacks Blockchain, and develop a basic smart contract that demonstrates fundamental functionality and a beginner understanding of the language. 

#### ‚§µÔ∏è [Build a Bitcoin NFT](https://github.com/hirosystems/MIT-Bitcoin-Expo-2022-Hiro-Hackathon-Resources#nfts-non-fungible-tokens)
Develop any platform or dApp component that uses the SIP-009 non-fungible token standard, written in Clarity, on the Stacks blockchain. Hackers could pursue a new NFT or collection, a marketplace for decentralized NFT management, or even an analytic dashboard to monitor the Stacks NFT market and network health. 

#### ‚§µÔ∏è [Develop a DeFi dApp](https://github.com/hirosystems/MIT-Bitcoin-Expo-2022-Hiro-Hackathon-Resources#defi-decentralized-finance)
DeFi (Decentralized Finance) enables a multitude of novel financial mechanisms like decentralized exchanges, yield farming, stablecoins, derivatives, crypto credit, and asset management. Teams could develop a component of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) built on Stacks, that runs on Clarity smart contracts. 

#### ‚§µÔ∏è [The Stacks <> Bitcoin Connection](https://github.com/hirosystems/MIT-Bitcoin-Expo-2022-Hiro-Hackathon-Resources#stacks--bitcoin-connection)
The Stacks Blockchain has a unique purview into the Bitcoin network, and synergy with BTC due to it powering the Stacks consensus mechanism. There have already been a handful of examples out in the community, experimenting with different ways Stacks and Bitcoin can interact. Hackers could choose to build any component of a decentralized application, or smart contract, that utilizes both the Stacks and Bitcoin networks, and performs some cross-chain functionality.

### My First Clarity Smart Contract
You may have considered building on blockchain in the past, but smart contract development appeared intimidating and unapproachable with user funds on the line. Fortunately, the Clarity smart contract language on Stacks is LISP-based and very easy to grok for beginner devs and expert engineers alike. We wanted to give hackers an opportunity to hack on the Stacks track, even if they‚Äôre questioning if they have enough experience to create a more robust submission.

We want you to build your first Clarity smart contract! It can be fairly basic, as long as it demonstrates that you took the hackathon to absorb Clarity education resources and documentation. There are hundreds of samples, templates, boilerplates, or just example Clarity smart contract files on Github. One of the best ways to learn is find and get familiar with a smart contract in the wild, fork it, and then tweak it incrementally into something totally new that achieves functionality you desire.

### NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
Develop any platform or piece of technology that uses the SIP-009 non-fungible token standard, written in Clarity, on the Stacks blockchain. 

#### Potential Submissions:
- An individual NFT
- An expanded NFT collection
- A generative NFT art series
- NFT Marketplace
- NFT Analytic Dashboard

[STXNFT Marketplace](https://stxnft.com/)
One of the largest NFT marketplaces on Stacks. Home to the most popular collections, and an accessible UI to browse, appraise, and trade NFTs.

[Bitcoin NFTs Explained: What They Are, How They Work, and Why You Should Build Them by Max Crawford](https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-nfts-explained-what-they-are-how-they-work-and-why-you-should-build-them)
Bitcoin NFTs are a concept that many developers are just now discovering is possible thanks to the Stacks blockchain, which is a programmable layer for Bitcoin.

### DeFi (Decentralized Finance)
DeFi is a new financial ecosystem, built on blockchain, in which users are totally in control of their funds, platforms are decentralized, and there is no barrier to entry like accredited investor status or brokerage fees. It enables a plethora of financial mechanisms like decentralized exchanges, yield farming, stablecoins, derivatives, crypto credit, and asset management. Hacker could develop a component of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) built on Stacks, that runs on Clarity smart contracts. Another option would be to build a dashboard that analyzes DeFi market statistics on Stacks.

[Bitcoin Economy, The Challenges of Bitcoin DeFi and How Stacks Addresses Them by Max Crawford](https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-economy-the-challenges-of-bitcoin-defi)
With Stacks, bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin, developers can unlock the full potential of DeFi for the Bitcoin ecosystem. But this surge of interest in Bitcoin DeFi comes with challenges.

[The Held Report - Bitcoin DeFi: Stacks Explained by Dan Held](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-defi-stacks-explained?s=r)
Building DeFi on top of Bitcoin makes sense as the base layer is the most unchanging, trustworthy, and decentralized blockchain to build upon.

### Stacks <> Bitcoin Connection
The Stacks Blockchain has a unique purview into the Bitcoin network, and synergy with BTC due to it powering the Stacks consensus mechanism. There have already been a handful of examples out in the community, experimenting with different ways Stacks and Bitcoin can interact. We want hackers to build any component of a decentralized application, or smart contract, that utilizes both the Stacks and Bitcoin networks and performs some cross-chain functionality. 

#### Examples and Research to get you started with the Stacks <> Bitcoin connection:
[LNSwap](https://www.lnswap.org/faq)
LNSwap is a non custodial crypto currency exchange that provides a fast, private way of swapping Bitcoin for Stacks and vice versa. Non custodial exchanges give you full control over your funds. A trade happens entirely and the user gets the exact amount of the asset they were promised, or a full refund is issued. This concept is called atomicity and it is achieved with so-called Submarine Swaps.

[Blog Post on Submarine Swaps by Boltz](https://medium.com/boltzhq/submarine-swaps-c509ce0fb1db)
A Submarine Swap is a way to trustlessly exchange coins from lightning to on-chain addresses and vice versa.

[‚ÄúBitcoin DeFi is Here: A Deep Dive into Trust-less Swaps‚Äù by Muneeb Ali](https://www.hiro.so/blog/bitcoin-defi-is-here-a-deep-dive-into-trust-less-swaps)
Stacks co-founder, Muneeb Ali, explains why STX is uniquely positioned to enable true Bitcoin DeFi, given Stacks contracts' visibility into the Bitcoin state as well as Stacks‚Äô inherent ability to leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs security and settlement assurances. The Stacks chain is tethered to Bitcoin through its Proof of Transfer consensus mechanism, so all Stacks transactions settle on Bitcoin. This ensures that Stacks shares Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term, unparalleled security for transaction reorgs.  

[get-block-info Documentation](https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/language-functions#get-block-info)
Can be used to compare data from both Stacks and Bitcoin. The get-block-info? function fetches data for a block of the given Stacks block height. Then, the merkle root of the Bitcoin transaction and the provided merkle proof is compared with the merkle root of the verified block. If these hashes are identical it can be concluded that the Bitcoin transaction was indeed included in the block on the Bitcoin chain.

["What Are Submarine Swaps? Send Bitcoin from Mainnet to Lightning Network & Back‚Äù by Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/submarine-swaps/)
Submarine swaps have several profound use cases and potential implications. Unlike atomic swaps ‚Äî where LN needs to be enabled on both cryptocurrencies participating in an exchange ‚Äî submarine swaps only need one side to be lightning enabled. As such, the future application of submarine swaps could see them becoming a vital infrastructure for decentralized exchange across various blockchains.

[Exploring the Possibilities of Wrapped Bitcoin (xBTC) on Stacks by Hiro Team](https://www.hiro.so/blog/exploring-the-possibilities-of-wrapped-bitcoin-xbtc-on-stacks)
Wrapped assets are super helpful for interoperability and are how networks can connect L1 tokens with DeFi. On the Stacks network, Bitcoin is bridged into xBTC by wrapping it. Now users have xBTC as a token on the Stacks network, and they can connect xBTC to DeFi applications.
